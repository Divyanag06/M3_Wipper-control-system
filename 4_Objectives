The aim of this project is to help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen 
when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is 
switching on and off the wiper. 

In rainy days we suffer from act of sprinkling of water on 
front glass of our wheeler. While driving car, driver cannot see on road vehicles. So he tries 
operating wiper on glass, for that he should often switch on for operating wiper and because 
of this it might cause vehicle accident.
