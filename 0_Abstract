The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile automatic 
rain wiper without driver interaction.
The system is developed to mitigate driving distractions 
and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving. 
The distraction eliminated with 
the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving 
in precipitation. 
The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a 
knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.
The 
system uses a combination of impedance and rain sensor to detect rain and its intensity. 
The 
system contains a controller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the 
operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals The aim of this project is to 
help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen 
when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is 
switching on and off the wiper. 
In rainy days we suffer from act of sprinkling of water on 
front glass of our wheeler.
